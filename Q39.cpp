// Q39. In software applications such as data analytics and probability systems, combinatorial values are frequently
// required. To ensure efficiency, developers avoid factorial-based solutions and use iterative logic with loops.
// As a Junior Software Developer, design a C++ program to generate Pascal’s Triangle for a given number of
// rows.
